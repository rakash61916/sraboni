<p>The online thesis archiving system is the side of the system where the students can explore, find references, read the archive's contents, and more. The students can simply register their system credentials. After they register their system account, the management will verify his/her account and if the admin has successfully verified the student account, the student will have permission to submit the project but still be upon approval of the management. He/She can also update the project he/she submitted. They can also list his/her own submitted projects whether it was published to the public or not.</p><p><br></p>
